| File | Description | Algorithm Type |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| `DNAMatch.py` | Finds the longest common subsequence between two DNA strings using both top-down and bottom-up dynamic programming approaches. | **Dynamic Programming** |
| `Puzzle.py` | Solves a 2D maze puzzle using breadth-first search (BFS) to find the shortest path between two points. | **Graph Traversal (BFS)** |
| `MinPuzzle.py` | Computes the minimum "effort" path through a grid where effort is the largest difference in adjacent values, using Dijkstra’s algorithm. | **Greedy / Dijkstra’s Algorithm** |
| `Amount.py` | Recursively finds all unique combinations of numbers in a list that sum to a target value. | **Backtracking** |
| `FeedDog.py` | Matches dogs with biscuits to satisfy hunger levels using a greedy strategy for maximum matches. | **Greedy Algorithm** |
| `MaxSet.py` | Identifies the maximum-sum subset of non-consecutive elements in a list using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach. | **Dynamic Programming** |
| `PowerSet.py` | Generates the power set (all subsets) of a given list using recursive backtracking. | **Backtracking** |
